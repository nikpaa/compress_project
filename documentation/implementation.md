# Implementation

note: this document is a work in progress

## Definition

The purpose of this project is to implement and benchmark DEFLATE -algorithm with Python.

Apparently the implementation of DEFLATE in zlib [has linear time complexity](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39654986/time-complexity-of-zlibs-deflate-algorithm) so the target of this project is to achieve linear time complexity as well.

For the purposes of reviewing, I'm a CS student and only know python.
